Well, two weeks ago, I developed my protein helper function. Before merging codes into the codespace, I will need to undergo a process "**code review**".

During the code review period, the code style will need to be aligned to the main codespace, the file will be organized better, and the design of the functions will be improved.

After a few rounds of the code review, the code will be merged soon.

## What specific things you will need to do during the code review?
### Develop test functions
After developing the new functions, one thing need to do is to write the test functions. The test functions can check whether you ruin some original functions when building the new functions. Also, test functions ensure that your code remains robust and prevent issues caused by careless contribution from others.

#### Simple example
This is a simple test to check whether the constants are read correctly.
```python
def test_standard_aa() -> None:
    """Test that STANDARD_AA contains the expected amino acids."""

    from prolif.constants import STANDARD_AA

    assert len(STANDARD_AA) == 26
    assert len(STANDARD_AA["ALA"]) == 4
    assert isinstance(STANDARD_AA["ALA"]["_chem_comp_atom"], pd.DataFrame)
```

#### Complicated example
[pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/) is a powerful package to create test functions. Here is a more complicated case for writing test functions. I used some decorator in pytest.

The below example is to use `@pytest.fixture` decorator. The fixture decorator can create a reliable context (input) for different test functions. Thus, you don't need to repeatedly define your inputs in each test function.

```python
@pytest.fixture(scope="module")
def XML_TEST_DATA() -> str:
    """Fixture to load the XML test data for altnames parsing."""
    return (datapath / "standard_aa_name.xml").read_text()


def test_xml_parse_altnames(XML_TEST_DATA: str) -> None:
    """Test the XML parsing of alternative names for residues and atoms."""

    resname_aliases, atomname_aliases = parse_altnames(XML_TEST_DATA)
    assert isinstance(resname_aliases, dict)
    assert isinstance(atomname_aliases, dict)
```

Another case is to use `@pytest.mark.parameterize`. If you want to tests different conditions of your function, it is helpful (to save your time to write the same codes).

```python
from prolif.io.protein_helper import ProteinHelper

@pytest.mark.parametrize(
    ("resnames", "expected"),
    [
        ({"HSD"}, "charmm"),
        ({"NASP"}, "amber"),
        ({"ASN1"}, "gromos"),
        ({"HISD"}, "oplsaa"),
        ({"CYS"}, "unknown"),
    ],
)
def test_forcefield_guesser(resnames, expected) -> None:  # type: ignore
    """Test the forcefield guesser."""

    # Test with a known forcefield
    forcefield = ProteinHelper.forcefield_guesser(resnames)
    assert forcefield == expected

```

### Check code/linter style and add type hints
Good coding practices include maintaining a consistent code style and having type hints, even though these don't affect the functionality or usability of the code. A consistent code style will increase the readability of code, which is especially important in a project with others.

**Here is an example without a consistent code/linter style and type hints:**
```python
import pandas as pd

def getGenus(df):
  Genus_name = list(df.index)
  return Genus_name
	
from collections import deque
class TreeNode :
    data  = None
    left  = None
    right = None
    def __init__(self,data=None, left = None ,right = None) :
        self.data  = data
        self.left    =   left
        self.right  = right
```

**After improvement:**
```python
import pandas as pd

from collections import deque

def getGenus(df: pd.DataFrame) -> list:
    """Document for getGenus function"""
    
    return list(df.index)

class TreeNode:
    """Tree Node document"""

    def __init__(self, data: Any = None, left: Any = None, right: Any = None):
        self.data = data
        self.left = left
        self.right = right
```

***Can you tell the difference between two examples?***     
(Give you five seconds to think about it.)   
.  
..  
...  
....   
.....  
***Here are what I found (you can check whether they are the same as your answers):***
1. In general, **all imported packages should be on the top** of the script (e.g. `import ...`, `from ...`).
2. **Spacing should be consistent.** You can choose either 2 or 4 spaces but you need to make sure it is consistent in the whole file. Also, make sure there is a fixed number of space before and after operators like `=` and seperators like `,` (e.g., `a, b, c` instead of `a ,   b,c`). 
3. **Add document in your function.** Use `""" ... """` to write the document. When people use your functions, it is more easier to know how they work.
4. **Add type hints in your function.** You can accelerate your code development if you know the type of the data. Same as others. If the user know what data type of the output of a function, the user won't spend lots of time to debug and check with the data. Thus, it would be better to have type hints.
5. **Remove redundant variable assignment.** You might notice that `getGenus` function is slightly different. The variable assignment "`Genus_name = list(df.index)`" is unnecessary. This can slightly speed up your code.

**Actually, there is a list of rules to make your code consistent, such as [PEP8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/), [Flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/), [isort](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/), etc. Some tools, like [Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/), can manage those rules and automatically format the code with a consistent set of code/linter styles.**


### Improve the design of the function
Sometimes, you might have a major revision of your function. In my case, I will need to inverting the rolo of two functions (`__init__` and `standardize_protein`).

#### Original protein helper function
In the original design of the protein helper function, the initialization requires a topology file of the molecule. The templates are provided during the standardization of the molecule. The output is stored in the protein helper function's `protein_mol`.  

```python
from prolif.datafiles import datapath
from prolif.io.protein_helper import ProteinHelper

# read the protein pdb
protein_path = datapath / "implicitHbond/1s2g__1__1.A_2.C__1.D/receptor_hsd.pdb"
protein_helper = ProteinHelper(input_topology=protein_path)

# standardize the protein (using default template by assigning templates with None)
protein_helper.standardize_protein(templates = None)

# the output is stored at 
protein_helper.protein_mol
```

#### The updated protein helper function
The new version of protein helper function is initialized using templates. The `standardize_protein` function is reusable for different proteins without requiring another protein helper function. See below example:  

```python
from prolif.datafiles import datapath
from prolif.io.protein_helper import ProteinHelper

# call a protein helper
protein_helper = ProteinHelper(templates = None)

# read and standardize the protein
protein_path = datapath / "implicitHbond/1s2g__1__1.A_2.C__1.D/receptor_hsd.pdb"
output_protein_mol = protein_helper.standardize_protein(input_topology=protein_path)

```

This design of protein helper function is more intuitive for users and is also more efficient. **However, I didn't come up with this design during development. My code reviewer (and my mentor), CÃ©dric, proposed this idea, and I suddenly realized it was true. This experience highlights how the code review process can definitely improve the quality of the code.**


## Code review process
You can see my progress of code review [here](https://github.com/chemosim-lab/ProLIF/pull/275). The pull request was created at the start of June (week 2-ish), but the discussion, code modifications and new code reviews have been ongoing until now. The code has been iterated through several rounds.

#### First version of the protein helper function

#### New version of the protein helper function with further discussions
![Round X](/images/blog_pics/gsoc-wk-6-002.png)


### Github bots help you check test coverage and type hints
For the code/linter style checking and type hints, they are routine tasks and can be automated with Github bots. Whenever I push a new commit, the bot runs these checks again and generates reports.

#### The report of the coverage of test functions.

#### The report of the coverage of type hints.

## Summary
Code review is a crucial part for open source code development. You will find some different opinions from different reviewers. You can explain more about your design and provide a strong rebuttal, or you can accept suggestions for modifying your code. All you need to know is:
> ***Everyone is making the package better.***

So, don't be upset if you have a lot of suggestions during code review. Be patient and sort it out!
